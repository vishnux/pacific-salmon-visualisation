# Pacific Salmon Visualisation

"The Southern Resident killer whales are focused on Pacific salmon as their primary prey source, especially large Chinook salmon returning to the big rivers of British Columbia (the Fraser) and Washington (the Columbia). Information about the marine distribution of salmon or the timing of their return to these rivers can help contextualize the acoustic and visual observations of SRKWs across their range -- from northern California to Alaska."
